**I advise projects and institutions in various areas of information technology and software development. My main focus is the management and publication of research data. This involves the use of web technologies as well as the operation of latest IT infrastructures.**

In addition to these activities, I work at the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research](https://pik-potsdam.de) in the [ISIMIP Project](https://www.isimip.org/). Furthermore, I support the [RDMO Project](https://rdmorganiser.github.io/) and I am part of the editorial board of [forschungsdaten.org](https://www.forschungsdaten.org) and of the organization team of the [Open Knowledge Labs Berlin](https://codefor.de/berlin/), which is part of the [Code for Germany network](https://codefor.de).
